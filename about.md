My name is Saurav, I live in India, I am an engineer by profession and I am interested in AI, quant and emerging technologies.

I have worked as a software engineer for more than a decade on enterprise systems in domains like supply chain, manufacturing, real estate, telecom; and developed B2B software products for drone mobility, IoT connectivity, etc.

In my role as a software engineer, I believe that a software engineer should also be good designer and have the mindset of a product manager, besides having good engineering skills. I try to bridge these gaps on the products or services I work on.

More about my experience on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sauravdey/).

Happy to connect!
